Hi Luke,

Our department identified a phising campaign in act.

We saw from a logged that you change the password during said campaign,
in order to confirm you were not a victim could please reply to this mail with the following information:
- Your current username
- Your current password 

In case you were a victim of the campaign we'll proceed to change your password and send you the new one.

Don't panic the situation is already handled.

Have a nice day!
Lucille
