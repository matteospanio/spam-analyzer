Our priorities are:

## Setting up the environment

We strongly suggest to run the project in a local virtual environment using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

Once you have installed your favourite virtual environment run `make setup` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` and you are done, now you can start tweak spam-detector making it better.

## Building

To build the package locally run in the root folder of the project `make build-develop`, it will create a local build that can be tested in your environment.
